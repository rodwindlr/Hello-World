# Hello-World

My First epository on GIthub

I'm a simple guy who doesn't have any knowledge in coding but wants to learn everything about it. I'm an owner of E-commerce Store that one day my programmer migrated to Canada and force me to study Wordpress basics and force me to make my own website. But my knowledge is not enough and I'm having troubles tweaking errors on my website. Now, I want to learn the basic of coding and everything that I need to know for me to optimize my website well and future websites that I'm planning to build.
